During epithelial morphogenesis, the basement membrane wrapping around the epithelium provides mechanical support to stabilize tissue morphology, yet it must grow extensively to keep up with the expanding epithelial surface. Recent studies reveal homeostatic turnover (Matsubayashi et al., 2020) and intra-matrix mobility (Keeley et al., 2020) of basement membrane components, highlighting that the basement membrane is a much more dynamic material than previously appreciated. However, it remains unknown how basement membrane production is controlled in space and time, and how its remodeling is coupled to morphogenesis. We are identifying regulators of basement membrane production and secretion. We are also exploring strategies to enable cell-autonomous basement membrane formation.
