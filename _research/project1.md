Branching morphogenesis is fundamentally a physical process. Because the shape change of cells usually occurs at a much smaller length scale, the shape change of the tissue mainly comes from cell proliferation and rearrangements. The preferred arrangement of cells in a tissue is determined by how cells interact with each other and how they interact with the extracellular matrix. Unlike inorganic objects, cells dynamically change their interacting properties in response to biochemical and biophysical stimuli. The challenge is to identify key factors from the complex and dynamic interactions between cells and matrix. Our current focus is to understand how mechanotransduction and cell-cell communication between epithelial cell subtypes are translated into cell specialization and duct formation. The ultimate goal is to identify the minimally required molecular modules for engineering a complete branched structure, which will serve as the structural basis to realize various customized functions.
