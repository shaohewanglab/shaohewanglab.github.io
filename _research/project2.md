Increased epithelial cell motility is a shared feature in embryonic organs undergoing rapid morphogenesis. Presumably, this motility serves to accelerate morphogenesis by enabling cell rearrangements. While cell motility has been extensively investigated on 2D substrates and in 3D matrices, its role in a tissue context is poorly understood. For example, it is unknown what stimulates or mediates cell migration within densely packed epithelial tissues, and it thus remains impossible to evaluate the role of cell motility in tissue morphogenesis. The mouse embryonic salivary gland provides a perfect model to address this important question. We aim to identify surface molecules coupling inrtracellular forces to the environment and regulatory machinery that can accelerate or decelerate cells.
