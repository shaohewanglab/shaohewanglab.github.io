Ryan is a rising sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley and is majoring in bioengineering with a minor in computer science. His interests mainly lie in computational biology, and is excited to use his computational skill set to assist in data and image analysis. In May 2024, Ryan joined us as a part of the Janelia-Meyerhoff Undergraduate Scholars Program.

Outside of the lab, Ryan enjoys playing basketball, watching anime, listening to EDM, and trying new foods.
