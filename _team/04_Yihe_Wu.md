Yihe is an undergraduate at the Basic Medical School of Peking University. Within the laboratory of Dr. Congying Wu, Yihe has mastered essential experimental techniques in molecular biology, gaining a deep understanding of how mechanical forces affect cell behavior and migration across a range of mechanical environments. Yihe has also ventured into the development of a light-induced proximity labeling tool aimed at investigating protein interactions within cells subjected to varying mechanical stimuli. In March 2024, Yihe joined us at Janelia for a six-month visiting program, bringing his expertise and enthusiasm for collaborative research and innovation.

Outside the lab, Yihe enjoys photography, reading, and playing games.
