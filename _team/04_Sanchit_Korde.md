Sanchit is a final-year BS-MS student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Berhampur, majoring in Biological Sciences with a minor in Engineering Biology. His research training at IISER Berhampur has equipped him with skills in cell culture models and transposon biology. He previously interned in the lab of Dr. Tapomoy Bhattacharjee at the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru, where he studied cell motility in bacterial strains within confined environments and worked on Agarose-Polyacrylamide microgels for 3D bioprinting. It was here that he discovered his passion for cellular dynamics and soft matter engineering. In May 2025, Sanchit is joining our lab as a Visiting Student Scientist.

Outside the lab, he enjoys reading, strength training, music, and is an avid follower of the Indian Cricket Team.
