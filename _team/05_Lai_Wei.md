Lai Wei was born and raised in Wuhan, China. He is a first-year graduate student in the Neuroscience Training Program at Johns Hopkins University. Lai received his B.S. in Biochemistry from the University of Minnesota (2021) and his M.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Johns Hopkins University (2023).
His primary research interests involve developing spatial transcriptomics techniques and analytical tools, and applying these to understand brain development and neurological diseases. Lai is currently rotating in Dr. Shaohe Wang's lab, where he is deciphering the glyco code in developing salivary glands and aiming to identify the cell surface molecules involved in this process.

Outside of the lab, Lai enjoys reading novels, exploring social science literature, and bartending.
