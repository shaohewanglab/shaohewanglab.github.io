Bella received her B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Virginia in 2017. During and after her undergraduate studies, Bella worked in Dr. John Lazoâ€™s lab studying the role of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 4A3 in various cancer cell lines. This work led to various grants and eventually the lab created the start-up KeViRx, Inc., which Bella help to get off the ground. Bella joined the cell culture team at Janelia in 2020 where she supported labs with their cell culture needs; she transferred to the lab coordinator team in July of 2022.

Outside of work, Bella enjoys spending time with friends and family, going to the gym, and trying new restaurants.
