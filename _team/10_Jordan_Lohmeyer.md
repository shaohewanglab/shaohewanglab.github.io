Jordan received her B.A. in Music from Christopher Newport University in 2020.  That summer, she moved down to central Florida to work for the Walt Disney World Resorts, Parks, and Travel Company in several different capacities, including performing in the Candlelight Processional in Epcot.  It was there she found a love for administrative work and customer service.  Jordan joined the Lab Coordinator team at Janelia in May 2024, and she is excited to bring her experience to the labs she supports to help further their scientific ventures.

Outside of work, Jordan enjoys spending time with friends and family, performing in community theater shows, traveling, and learning new card/board games.
