Angelo received his B.S. in Microbiology and Parasitology from National University of San Marcos (Lima, Peru) in 2012. Currently, Angelo is a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/tyska-lab/" target="_blank">Dr. Matt Tyska’s lab</a> at Vanderbilt University, where he investigates how actin bundling proteins orchestrate the assembly of epithelial microvilli using intestinal tissue, cell culture models, and single molecule reconstitution assays. Angelo will be joining Shaohe Wang’s lab as a postdoc at Janelia’s 4D Cellular Physiology research program in the spring of 2023.

Outside the lab, Angelo enjoys reading, listening to podcasts, watching documentaries and soccer games.
