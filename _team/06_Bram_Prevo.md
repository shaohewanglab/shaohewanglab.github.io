Bram uses his interdisciplinary background in physics, biology, and advanced imaging to study how molecular machines orchestrate cell function. He completed his B.Sc. and M.Sc. (cum laude) in Medical Natural Sciences at VU University Amsterdam in 2009, studying DNA mechanics with Prof. Wuite and kinesin-1 dynamics with Prof. Peterman.

He received his Ph.D. in Biophysics from VU University Amsterdam in 2015, advised by Prof. Scholey (UC Davis) and Prof. Peterman. There, he developed the single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and image analysis framework to quantitatively dissect intraflagellar transport in vivo.

He then joined Prof. Desai’s laboratory (UC San Diego) to expand his expertise in quantitative fluorescence microscopy and genome engineering, investigating cytoplasmic dynein’s role during cell division and cytoskeletal dynamics in neurodevelopment.

Bram was awarded a Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship in 2019, working with Prof. Earnshaw at the University of Edinburgh, UK. Here, he developed image analysis techniques and multifocus fluorescence microscopy to study molecular motors in 3D genome organization.

Recently, he became a Janelia Visiting Postdoctoral Associate, collaborating with Dr. Wang to study the force dynamics during C. elegans neurodevelopment and that of other motor-driven systems. 

Outside of work, he enjoys biking and spending time with his family.
