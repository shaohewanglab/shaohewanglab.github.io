Shunze Yao is a fourth year undergraduate student in Medical School of Peking University (Beijing, China). He majors in Basic Medicine, which means that he will conduct disease-related fundamental scientific research in future career rather than becoming a doctor. He is particularly interested in mechanobiology and cell biology, with focus on the interaction between membrane-bound and membrane-less organelles. Currently, he is a member of Dr. Congying Wu's lab which experts on cell migration. Shunze will be working with us in the summer, and he is excited about the upcoming academic feast and research experience in Janelia.

Outside the lab, Shunze enjoys music and likes to explore various delicious food.
